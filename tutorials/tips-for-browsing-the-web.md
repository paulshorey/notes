# Tips for browsing the web

### Google Search results

have been having a hard time keeping up with all the nonsense out there. It's amazing what Google/Bing are able to do. Google has many more "advanced search" features, letting you search inside a certain site or date range or file type, or use advanced operators like quotes or minus sign to exclude a word. So, Google is better... except that it very often gives very outdated 10+ year old results! Especially when I'm searching for technology and cultural topics, that is beyond outdated. What to do?

Google Search lets you specify the date range of results. You can search only pages that have been written in the past year, month, days, few years, etc. However, you have to do this each time. It does not remember your preference. Too much clicking. There is a trick to make it remember.
