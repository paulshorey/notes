# Railway Infrastructure as Code

This file defines the Notes Railway project. Before its first apply,
authenticate and link the repository, then import the live project with
`railway config pull --force`. Keep every imported resource (such as databases,
volumes, buckets, and custom domains) in this specification when reconciling
the imported file with the service settings here. A whole-project IaC file
treats an omitted resource as a deletion. Run `railway config plan` from the
repository root and apply only after the plan contains no unexpected destructive
changes.
