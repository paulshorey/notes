# Technical documentation

{% embed url="https://medium.com/@kevinast/integrate-gitbook-jsdoc-974be8df6fb3" caption="^^ Good overview, but very outdated. GitBook is no longer open-source, but this could still work !!" %}

> Good documentation should include two distinct elements — a **Guide** and an **API**:
>
> 1. The **Guide** builds concepts, providing examples, etc. [GitBook ](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook)is well suited to generate the Guide, supporting a variety of options, using standard [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
> 2. The **API** provides low-level specifics, with function signatures, details, etc. [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) \(a descendant of [JavaDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc)\) is ideal to define the low-level API. Using this technique, the API is defined from embedded comments in the code itself.

See more info and tools **on the left nav menu**, expanded under "Technical Documentation"

This guide is outdated, but it could still work. Instead of reading the whole article, I'm just going to 

1\) convert my JSDocs into markdown, 

2\) shove the files into my GitBook markdown folder,

3\) try to integrate links into GitBook navigation menu
