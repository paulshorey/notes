# Build the App APK

## When to run

Only do this if you are in the Cursor cloud workspace environment. Skip this if developing locally in the user's desktop IDE.

## Build the APK

Generate the canonical dev APK file by running this command from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm --filter notes-android build:dist:dev
```

This writes `apps/notes-android/dist/notes-android.apk`, overwriting the previous APK.

## Commit and push the APK

After the build succeeds:

```bash
BRANCH="$(git branch --show-current)"
git add apps/notes-android/dist/notes-android.apk
# Stage any additional task files too.
git commit -m "Describe the feature and rebuilt APK"
git push -u origin "$BRANCH"
```

## Share the direct GitHub download URL with the user

How to get the raw downloadable URL:

```bash
BRANCH="$(git branch --show-current)"
ORIGIN_URL="$(git remote get-url origin)"
REPO_PATH="$(printf '%s\n' "$ORIGIN_URL" | sed -E 's#^https://[^/]+/##; s#\.git$##; s#^git@github\.com:##')"
echo "https://github.com/${REPO_PATH}/raw/refs/heads/${BRANCH}/apps/notes-android/dist/notes-android.apk"
```

Include a link to that URL in your final response so the user can download and sideload the APK.

Format as markdown, like this:

```
[Direct download APK](https://github.com/paulshorey/notes/raw/refs/heads/BRANCH_NAME/apps/notes-android/dist/notes-android.apk)
```
