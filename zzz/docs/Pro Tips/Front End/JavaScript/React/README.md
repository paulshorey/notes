# React  
  
### Shorthand (only render method, no lifecycle):  
  
```javascript  
const Profile = props => {  
  
  // validate inputs  
  if (!props.someList || !props.someList.length) {  
      return null;  
  }  
  
  // what are we rendering?  
  const Items = [];  
  for (let i=0; i<props.someList.length; i++) {  
      Items.push(<li>{props.someList[i]}</li>);  
  };  
  
  // ok, lets render it  
  return (<ol>{Items}</ol>);  
};  
```

### this.state  
**Set state only after render(), in componentDidUpdate() and custom methods.**, always being paranoid to avoid infinite loops.  
  
**Also,**  
Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.  
```javascript  
    /* do this if there's any possibility of vars changing in the meanwhile */  
    this.setState((state, props)=>(  
        { counter: state.counter + props.increment }  
    ));  
```

### Version 17 (new and renamed lifecycle methods):  
* UNSAFE_componentWillMount  
* UNSAFE_componentWillRecieveProps  
* UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate  
* **getDerivedStateFromProps** (prevProps, prevState) {}  
    * This method is going to handle what **componentWillRecieveProps** was able to do along with **componentDidUpdate**. It is static. It is called after a component is created and also called when it receives a new prop. This will be the safer alternative to **componentWillRecieveProps**.  
* **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate** (prevProps, prevState) {}  
    * This is going to handle what **componentWillUpdate** was able to do along with **componentDidUpdate**. This is called right before the DOM is updated. The value that is returned from **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate** is passed on to **componentDidUpdate**.
