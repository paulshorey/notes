  
### Why [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is the best JavaScript IDE:  
  
* It indents JSX correctly every time.  
  
* It is a premium commercial product (read: "reliable"). It has program settings which all actually do what they're supposed to when you change them. WebStorm is a good little robot that does as you command it.  
  
* It lets you choose to put arguments on the same line as the brackets and commas, or each bit of code on its own line. Other code formatters use one or the other convention. Webstorm (like Emacs) can detect your intention, and format the indentation without breaking your coding style. It lets you be human and creative.  
  
* Key mapping has a very easy search interface. Feel free to remap all your favorite shortcuts, including Macros. It even lets you search key assignment by pressing the key combination.  
  
  
### Other benefits...  
  
It has several more sophisticated features - ones you would have to spend a long time finding and configuring just right in open source editors.  
  
* When you re-name a file or folder, it can search all the source code in the project, and rename any references to that file, to prevent broken links.  
  
* Pressing "Backspace" (Delete on Mac) when all you have to the left is whitespace, WebStorm deletes all the way to the end of the previous line, with one key stroke.  
    * Vs Code deletes one indentation level at a time, then you must press again to delete the new line  
    * Sublime Text actually is even worse. When indenting using spaces (for example 4), instead of deleting 4 spaces at a time, it deletes one space at a time.  
  
* Lint tooltips are easier to use and read  
  
* Syntax highlighting - customizing the scheme takes a bit of getting used to when coming from Sublime/VsCode. But it has more powerful and more sophisticated syntax coloring! For example, WebStorm is smart enough to color function curly brackets differently than React variable curly brackets which contain the function.

### Unfortunately,  
* It costs $130+. But, if you are trying to get paid for the code you write, then you will make back this amount very quickly. I have seen a productivity increase after just a couple days of getting used to it.

# Getting Started with WebStorm  
  
### Tips:  
* Disable all unnecessary left/bottom/top menus, to have a clean interface.  
* If you lose the file tree, press `Cmd+1`. Also press it to enter the navigaton, to open or rename a file without using the mouse.  
* In file browser left column, open file with one click instead of two:  
    ```  
        Project settings [...] > Autoscroll to source  
    ```  
     Best syntax highlighting:  
     ```  
        WebStorm > Preferences > Editor > Color Scheme > General > "Monokai Pro"  
    ```  
* Install **Material Theme** when first installing WebStorm, or as a Plugin. *Material refers to the WebStorm application UI (**not the code/text**) styling.* Theme refers to the header,menus,file browser, status bar, etc. Use this Material `One Dark` "Theme" to nicely match the Monokai "Scheme" above.

# Import Settings:  
Includes auto-format macro and key binding `Cmd + S` to Esc, Format, Save.  
Also key binding `Cmd + D` to do incremental find + add word to multiple cursor, like in Sublime/VsCode.  
And theme/colors/plugins.
