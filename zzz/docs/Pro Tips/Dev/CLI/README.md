#### Files and Folders:

or use **`rsub`** to open the remote file in your local editor like Sublime/VsCode  
  
**`sudo echo "export PATH=\"$PATH:/usr/local/bin\"" >> /etc/profile`** write to bottom of file  
  
**`vim`** is a built-in and usually default text editor. Nice Editor is much nicer!

#### Permissions:  
  
**`chmod -R 600 ~/.ssh/YOUR-FILE`** you'll need to apply this to any newly created SSH key file before GIT can use it  
  
**`chown -R $USER /www`** or whatever folder or file you want to take back ownership of  
  
**`sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME`** even better! assign to current user and group
